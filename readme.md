# Project Name

FlexiMvvm

## Description

Based on the experience gained building mobile cross-platform applications with **Xamarin** and leveraging this framework's major advantages, implementing **FlexiMvvm** became crucial to address the minimal time to market demand and maintain overall product quality constrained to high standards for our clients.

The following aims were pursued while developing FlexiMvvm:
* Proper application architecture is driven and consistently reused across different projects, by different teams
* Proper code sharing approach is incorporated, introducing clear decomposition of application layers
* Flexibility and reasonable level of abstraction from native platform APIs is established, preserving an easy way to access capabilities with less code
* Smooth learning curve for new members during onboarding, simplifying a range of challenging mobile-specific tasks
* Infrastructural efforts are minimal as typical functionality is provided

## Current Status

Current state should be considered as a Developer Preview version.
